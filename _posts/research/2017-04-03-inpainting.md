<p>
Living in the Mission district I frequently see a lot of tourists, a lot of graffiti and a lot of litter. One day I 
grew concerned - what if all of the pictures the tourists take accidentally contained graffiti or litter?
</p>

<p>
This concern led me to explore inpainting - the process of reconstructing regions of an image. The tool I made allows 
for a user to indicate the region of a photograph to be replaced and then uses exemplar-based texture synthesis to fill 
in the region.

This project implements the academic paper 
<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1323101">Region Filling and Object Removal by Exemplar-Based Image Inpainting</a>
by Criminisi et al.
