<p>
Creating a panorama can be seen as the combination of many different computational photography techniques.
Depending on the technique used warping, <a href="/pyramid-blending">blending</a>, and corner detection may all be used.
</p>

<p>
There are many tools that create very nice panoramas but looking at the process can be quite illuminating. 
</p>

<p>
This research resulted in a program that makes panoramas by finding a homography between the input images, warping
them into alignment, performing a multi-frequency blend and then an automated crop.
</p>

<p>
First the corners of all the input images need to be found.  Then matches between the two images need to be located. 
For this step, the OpenCV <a href="https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/d3/da1/classcv_1_1BFMatcher.html">Brute Force Matcher</a> 
can be used.
</p>
<p>
Once there is a list of the matching features between the images a homography can be found that connects the images. 
At this point, the “canvases” of the input image can be warped so that they align.
</p>

<p>
After this step the images can be stitched and blended through a variety of ways, in this case Pyramid Blending was used.
