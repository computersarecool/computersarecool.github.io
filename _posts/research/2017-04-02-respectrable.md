<p>
The Live Object Model (LOM) is a bit of a maze but provides complete access to the Ableton Live API.  There is a 
learning curve to figuring out how the object hierarchy functions but, once figured out, each and every property of a 
Live set is configurable with code.
</p>

<p>
The repeated necessity of a scriptable, real-time audio engine, and specifically one that could be used wirelessly 
through <a href="http://opensoundcontrol.org/introduction-osc"> Open Sound Control</a> (OSC) led to the creation of Respectrable.
</p>

<p>
Respectrable is a Max for Live device that facilitates easily accessing the Live Object Model through Javascript or Max objects.
