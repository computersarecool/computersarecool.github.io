<p>
The first point is to create a system where any property of a Live set can be changed by sending an Open Sound Control (OSC) message to the Ableton Live API. 
</p>

<p>
The second point is that any change made to a Live set sends an OSC notification.
In this way a Live set can control -- or be controlled by -- anything that uses OSC.
</p>

<p>
Respectrable is a Max for Live device that facilitates this.
