It was basically impossible to work at Obscura Digital and not work on architectural projections at some point. After a 
while projection jobs can get repetitive. One exception was this projection job done at Shantou University.
</p>

<p>
While visiting to work on another project, we were asked to do an architectural projection on a newly completed campus 
medical building. Although there was only one day to prepare, rehearse and project the building's shape lent itself well 
to the task.

There was no photographer scheduled for this job but luckily some students at the university were taking a drone 
photography class nearby and captured much of the event.
