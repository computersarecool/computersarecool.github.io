<p>
It is the year 04000 AD. 
</p>

<p>
A group of dancing astronauts has been lost in space for the last eight years searching for their
home planet of Cydonia. 
</p>

<p>
With nothing else to do besides explore outer space and listen to the hottest Nu-disco cuts this team of explorers might
just find home.
</p>

<p>
At least that is what the back story is. 
</p>

<p>
This unique Audio-Visual performance took place in San Francisco and for one hour the crowd became the crew of 
a digital spaceship in search of Cydonia.
</p>

<p>
Twelve Android tablets and custom software became the audio visual controllers as well as the display medium and 
people in the crowd were invited to control the music, visuals and outer space exploration. 
</p>

<p>
The featured images show concept design and some of the user interface designs for the tablets and the video shows
actual footage from the event.
