<p>
It is the year 04000 CE. 
</p>

<p>
A group of dancing astronauts has been lost in space for the last eight years searching for their
home planet of Cydonia. 
</p>

<p>
With nothing else to do besides explore outer space and listen to the hottest Nu-disco cuts this team of explorers might
just find their long-lost home...
</p>

<p>
At least that is what the back story is. 
</p>

<p>
This unique audio-visual performance, which took place in San Francisco, transformed the crowd into the crew of 
a digital spaceship in search of Cydonia.
</p>

<p>
Twelve Android tablets and custom software simultaneously operated as the audio-visual controllers as well as the 
display medium.
</p>

<p>
In an effort to promote interactivity, the new crew members were invited to adjust the the music, visuals and explore outer space
via the tablet interface that was custom made for this event. 
</p>

<p>
The featured images show concept design and some of the user interface designs for the tablets while the video shows
some footage from the event.
