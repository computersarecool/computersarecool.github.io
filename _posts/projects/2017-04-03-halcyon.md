    - p: 'The software requirements for the visual control system at 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=halcyon+sf">Halcyon</a> in San Francisco were straightforward. It 
needed to control nine HD projectors as well as the club lighting system. More interesting was the process of pixel 
mapping the 20 universes of individually addressable LEDs.'

    - p: 'Mapping LEDs is a commonly sought after task. Typically people create a structure, cover it with strips of
LEDs and then want to be able to apply a video or image to that structure. This is where it usually gets more 
interesting.' 

    - p: 'The mapping approach used at Halcyon was very similar to how texture mapping works in 3D animation and parts
of the process are shown in the second image. The process went like this:'

    - ul:
      - Create a 3D model of the structure with a vertex for each LED
      - Unwrap and UV map the model
      - Apply a texture to the newly UV mapped model
      - Sample the color at each vertex and set each LED to this value

  -
      - p: 'In this way anyone can pre-visualize how content is going to appear on the structure in real time. The 
featured video shows the final installation before the nightclub opened. There are more examples
