<p>
The software the contolled the visual system at 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=halcyon+sf">Halcyon</a> in San Francisco was straightforward.
It controlled nine HD projectors and interfaced with the native club lighting system.  More interesting was the process
of mapping the 20 universes of invidually addressable LEDs.
</p>

<p>
Mapping LEDs is a common task. Typically people create a 3D structure, cover it with individually addressable LEDs and
then want to be able to apply a video or image to that structure.
</p>

<p>
The approached used at Halcyon was very similar to how texture mapping works in 3D animation and is depicted in the second featured image.
It went like this:
<ul>
  <li>Coffee</li>
  <li>Tea</li>
  <li>Milk</li>
</ul>
</p>

The featured video shows the final installation before the nightclub opened. There are more examples
