    - p: "It was nearly impossible to work at Obscura Digital and not work on architectural projection mapping at 
some point."

    - p: "This spur of the moment event at Shantou University in Shantou, Guangdong, China was particularly 
memorable because of the unique building facade and the compressed production timeline."

  -
    - p: "While visiting the university to work on a different, unrelated projection mapping project, we were asked
to do an architectural projection show on the newly completed campus medical building."

    - p: "The initial request came approximately 24 hours before the show was supposed to happen (at least that was 
when I first heard of it)."

    - p: "There was only one day to prepare content, create the show and align the projectors but the building's
      shape lent itself so well to projection that it was hard to resist."

  -
    - p: "Because of the scheduling constraints there was no photographer scheduled to capture the job and it came 
close to not being documented at all."

    - p: "Luckily some students at the university were taking a drone photography class 
nearby and captured footage of the event which they were happy to share
in exchange for a presentation on how to projection map buildings."
