    - p: 'It was nearly impossible to work at <a href="https://www.msg.com/obscura-digital" class="nobreak">Obscura 
Digital</a> and not work on architectural projection mapping at some point.'

    - p: 'This spur of the moment event at <a href="http://english.stu.edu.cn/index.php" class="nobreak">Shantou 
University</a> in Shantou, Guangdong, China was particularly memorable because of the unique building facade and the 
compressed production timeline.'

  -
    - p: 'While visiting the university to work on a different, 
<a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/30113999/Shantou-University-Graduation">unrelated projection mapping project</a>, 
we were asked to do an architectural projection show on the newly completed campus medical building.'

    - p: "The initial request came approximately 24 hours before the show was supposed to happen (at least that was 
when I first heard of it)."

    - p: "There was only one day to prepare content, set up the projectors and create the show but the building's
shape was unique enough that it was hard to resist the opportunity."

  -
    - p: "The scheduling constraints meant there was no photographer scheduled to capture the job and it came close to 
not being documented at all."

    - p: "Luckily some students at the university were taking a drone photography class 
nearby and captured footage of the event which they were happy to share in exchange for a presentation on how to 
projection map buildings."

    - p: "The footage they captured is included in the featured video."
