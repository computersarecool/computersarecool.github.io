It was basically impossible to work at Obscura Digital and not work on projection mapping at some point. 
This spur of the moment event at Shantou University provided a memorable surface for architectural mapping.
</p>

<p>
While visiting the university to work on another project, we were asked to do an architectural projection on the newly 
completed campus medical building. There was only one day to prepare content and create a run of show but the building's
shape lent itself so well to projection that it was hard to resist.

There was no official photographer to capture this job but luckily some students at the university were taking a drone 
photography class nearby and captured much of the event.
