<p>
There are many screens at AT&T Stadium. There are two rows of "ribbon" screens surrounding the stadium bowl, the
"Diamond Vision" ðŸ’Ž and the "AT&T LiveFX" board. Usually different content plays on all the various
screens but in certain situations immersive content plays across all the screens in the stadium.

<p>
The challenge was to create a user interface that was recognizable enough that stadium personel would feel
comfortable enough to takeover all the screens in the stadium instantaneously.
