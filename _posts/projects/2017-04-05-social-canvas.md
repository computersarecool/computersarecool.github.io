<p>
Social Canvas is probably the world's largest multiplayer game installation.  It functions like most tile-matching video
games except on a much, much larger scale.
</p>

<p>
Visitors to MGM Cotai can quickly join the game by scanning a QR code and submit entries by sending messages to a 
dedicated WeChat channel. 
</p>

<p>
These entries are then displayed in “The Spectacle”, MGM’s term for the world’s largest area of permanent indoor LED screens that makes up their lobby and casino entrance.
</p>

<p>
MGM's write up is <a href="https://www.mgm.mo/en/cotai/art/art-tour/collaboration/social-canvas">here</a>. The featured
videos show an overview of the project and a demo of the project in action.
