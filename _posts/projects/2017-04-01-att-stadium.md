<p>
There are many screens at AT&T Stadium. There are two rows of "ribbon" screens surrounding the stadium bowl, the
"Diamond Vision" ðŸ’Ž and the "AT&T LiveFX" board. Usually different content plays on all the various
screens but in certain situations immersive content plays across all the screens in the stadium.
</p>

<p>
The challenge was to create a user interface that was recognizable enough that stadium personel would feel
comfortable enough to takeover all the screens in the stadium instantaneously. 
</p>

<p>
In addition to writing the software, on a few occasions I served as the operator as well. During the immersive moments 
the Show Director would call out which "moment" he wanted triggered with an emphatic countdown - my narration is a much 
slower interpretation of his epic call.
