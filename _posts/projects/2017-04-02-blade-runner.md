The last Obscura Digital Holiday party was one of the most visually amazing events I have ever witnessed.  The entire company teamed up to cover the space from floor to ceiling with Blade Runner themed visuals.

At the time there was a lot of equipment moving around the warehouse and so I convinced management to let me turn an old 
-- but large -- touchscreen into an audio/visual/laser controller. After that I convinced my colleague 
<a href="http://www.michaelwalczyk.com/">Mike Walczyk</a> to help me with the concept and the result was this.
