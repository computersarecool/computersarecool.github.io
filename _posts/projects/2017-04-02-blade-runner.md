            The entire company teamed up to cover Obscura's Pier 70 warehouse from floor to ceiling with Blade Runner themed 
            visuals and there were multiple live performances, including this one."

        - p: 'At the time there was a lot of equipment moving around the warehouse so I convinced management to let me turn an 
            old but large touchscreen into an audio/visual/laser controller. After that I convinced my colleague 
            <a href="http://www.michaelwalczyk.com/" class="nobr">Mike Walczyk</a> to help me with the concept and 
            this project was the result.'

    - content:
        - p: "The futuristic interfaces present in both Blade Runner films are an integral part of their overall style and
            it seemed necessary to reference them in proper cyberpunk form at the party (along with lots and lots of haze). 
            The featured video is worth watching in its entirety, this project appears at 1:35."
