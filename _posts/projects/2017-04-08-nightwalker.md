NightWalker is a colorful clothing line that explores the future while paying homage to the past.
</blockquote>

<p>
With a catchphrase such as that it was difficult not to be interested in working with this cutting edge clothing 
company. 
</p>

<p>
In 2010, when development started on the flagship web app, nothing was hotter than the MEAN stack.
</p>

<p>
With little enterprise experience I jumped into MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js and got serious exposure to 
Amazon Web Services.
</p>

<p>
Although the clothing line quickly transitioned to existing online marketplaces, the experience gained in creating an 
actually interactive web app was invaluable.
</p>

<p>
When mobile visitors reached the site, instead of having to drag and scroll to see all the colors (or "flavors" as they 
were known), they could simply rotate their phones to see each of the eight options.
