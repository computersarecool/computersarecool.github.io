NightWalker is a colorful clothing line that explores the future while paying homage to the past
</blockquote>

<p>
During the search for an early development job the above slogan, along with the promise of a cutting edge approach to development 
and clothing production, was eye-catching. 
</p>

<p>
In 2010, when development started on the flagship NightWalker web app, nothing was hotter than the MEAN stack.
With little enterprise experience I jumped into MongoDB, Express, Angular and Node.js and got serious exposure to 
Amazon Web Services.
</p>

<p>
Although the clothing line quickly transitioned to using existing online marketplace solutions, the experience gained 
in creating an truly interactive web app was invaluable.
</p>

<p>
When mobile visitors reached the site, instead of having to drag or scroll to see all the colors (or "flavors" as they 
were known) of pants, they could simply rotate their phones to see each of the eight options.
