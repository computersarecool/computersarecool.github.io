<p>
There are many screens at AT&T Stadium. There are two rows of "ribbon" screens surrounding the stadium bowl, the 
"Diamond Vision" ðŸ’Ž and the "AT&T LiveFX" board. Usually different content plays on all the various screens but in 
certain "takeover" situations immersive content plays across all stadium screens.
</p>

<p>
From a design perspective, the challenge on this project was to create a user interface familiar enough to stadium 
personnel that they would feel comfortable enough to takeover all the screens in the stadium with the press of a button.
</p>

<p>
In addition to writing the show control software, I got the great opportunity to evaluate my programming <i>in situ</i> 
while serving as its operator on a several occasions. 
</p>

<p>
During the takeover situations the director would call out which "moment" he wanted played with an emphatic countdown.
My narration in the featured video is a much slower (and less enthusiastic) interpretation of his fairly epic call outs.
