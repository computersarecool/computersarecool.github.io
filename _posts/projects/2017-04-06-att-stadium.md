<p>
There are many screens at AT&T Stadium. There are two rows of "ribbon" screens surrounding the stadium bowl, the 
"Diamond Vision" ðŸ’Ž and the "AT&T LiveFX" board. Usually different content plays on all the various screens but in 
certain situations immersive content plays across all stadium screens.
</p>

<p>
The challenge was to create a user interface familiar enough to stadium personnel that they would feel comfortable 
enough to takeover all the screens in the stadium with the press of a button.
</p>

<p>
In addition to writing the software, I served as the operator on a few occasions. During the immersive moments the 
Director would call out which "moment" he wanted played with an emphatic countdown - my narration in the featured video 
is a much slower interpretation of his epic call.
