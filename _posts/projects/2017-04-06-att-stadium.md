        - p: 'There are many screens at AT&T Stadium. There are two rows of "ribbon" screens surrounding the stadium 
            bowl, the "Diamond Vision" ðŸ’Ž and the "AT&T LiveFX" board. Usually different content plays on all the various 
            screens but in certain "takeover" situations immersive content plays across all stadium screens.'

    - content:
        - p: "From a design perspective, the challenge on this project was to create a user interface familiar enough to
            stadium personnel that they would feel comfortable enough to takeover all the screens in the stadium with the 
            press of a button."

    - content:
        - p: 'In addition to writing the show control software, I got the great opportunity to evaluate my programming 
            <i>in situ</i> while serving as its operator on a several occasions.'

    - content:
        - p: 'During the takeover situations the director would call out which "moment" he wanted played with an 
            emphatic countdown. My narration in the featured video is a much slower (and less enthusiastic) interpretation
            of his fairly epic call outs.'
