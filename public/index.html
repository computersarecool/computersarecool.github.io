    To conveniently use Latex for mathematics in web pages, a nice tool seems to be
    <a href="http://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a>.  (I found it supported by APS, the
    <em>American Physical Society</em>.) Here is the briefest, while sufficient, intro to it.
  </p>

<p>
  A one&ndash;line JavaScript call is needed in the preamble, which loads the program
  from their web site. Then, one simply types latex where math is wanted, along with
  HTML (for example \( e^{\boldsymbol{i} \, (\beta+\pi)} \) here), using latex's usual
  math&ndash;mode delimiters. The exponent above is entered, in the middle of HTML code,by
  <pre>
    ... (for example \( e^{\bm{i} \, (\beta+\pi)} \) here) ...
  </pre>
<p>
  With MathJax present this <em>is</em> recognized as a chunk of mathematics to process,
like it would be in a latex document, and is handled as such. Then it is displayed by
HTML-CSS or MathML (so that it scales well etc) &mdash; these are <em>not</em> images.
One can right-click on an equation and adjust some properties, copy source, etc. To get
a nice and quick start, see their
<a href="http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/start.html">documentation</a>.
Here is an example copied from that page:
</p>

<p style="margin: 20px 0 20px 40px; ">
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) and they are
$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.
$$
</p>

<p>
This example is produced by:
<pre>
When $a \ne 0$, there are two solutions to \( ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \) and they are
$$
x = {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac} \over 2a}.
$$
</pre>

<p>
There are some things to watch out for, like (single) dollar signs, &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo;
signs, etc, since both HTML and Latex are processed, one after another (in this order).
For this example (using &#36; for inline&ndash;math delimiters) one does need another
JavaScript segment in the preamble, see below.

<p>
If you look at the HTML source of this page, you will find three short JavaScript
entries in the preamble. The <em>last</em> one calls the program from MathJax site,
and this apparently should be last.  This is all that must be called, and one can do
full math. (The program can be installed locally instead.)
</p>

<p>
The other JavaScript segments are for MathJax configuration. The first one allows use
of dollar signs to delimit inline math, along with (default) <code>\( ... \)</code>.
The second one loads Tex extensions, here one that will add
<code>\boldsymbol{...}</code> automatically around math that happens to be within bold
HTML, and one that enables use of AMS symbols.  Extensions can also be included directly
in the script that calls MathJax, and this is how AMS&ndash;math is enabled in this page.
See documentation, in particular for
<a href="http://www.mathjax.org/docs/1.1/tex.html#tex-support">Tex/Latex support.</a>
</p>

<p> For nice examples, go to a
<a href="http://www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/"> MathJax demo page</a>.
(Right-click on equations, choose "Show source;" it's full latex.)
